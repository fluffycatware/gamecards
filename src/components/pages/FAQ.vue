      <p>GameCard let you <router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#buy-card' }" >buy</router-link>, <router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#lease-card' }" >lease</router-link> and <router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#sell-card' }" >sell</router-link> cards.
      GameCard homepage is filled with cards ranked from 1 to 100. Each card is sold at a price related to its rank, the card #1 is initially sold at 1 Ether and card #100 is set at 0.01 Ether.
      A card is made from a descriptive title, a redirection URL and an image set by the card owner.
      For each card sold during the initial sale, <b>10% of the amount is reversed to <router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#what-is-fluffycat' }" >FluffyCat</router-link></b> !
      </p>
      <p>If no cards are available to buy, you probably can rent one. You'll pay to the card owner a fixed amount of Ether to display
      your details for a pre-determined duration.</p>
      <div class="ui stackable grid">
        <div class="column ten wide">
          <p>Once you purchased a card, it belongs to <b>you</b>. From here you have multiple options :</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b><router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#lease-card' }" >Rent</router-link></b> it out to someone for a fixed price and duration</li>
            <li><b><router-link :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#sell-card' }" >Sell</router-link></b> it to a fixed price</li>
            <li><b><router-link class="item" :to="{ name: 'FAQ', hash: '#edit-card' }" >Edit</router-link></b> your card details</li>
            <li><b>Leave</b> it as it is</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can <b>rent out</b> your card to someone willing to rent it. As owner, you will get the total rent amount beforehand.
            During the lease, the card will display and redirect to the details provided by the tenant. Once the lease end,
            the card display your details again.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Selling</b> a card is as simple as setting a sale price and voilà, your card can now be bought by anyone. The ownership
            will be transferred to the first buyer and you will be credited of the sale amount !
          </p>
          <p>
            You can <b>edit</b> your cards at any time in the card <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> <b>Settings</b>

            to display its details and settings). From there, you may also <b>transfer the ownership</b> of your card.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, you can just <b>leave</b> your card(s) with your details and strut around that you own one (or more !) of 100 unique cards.

        So, what's the deal ?
      </h2>
      <p>Although GameCard looks like a regular website, it's not one, it's a Decentralized Applications (ÐApps). Cards are not loaded from our database (we do not host anything) but instead directly loaded from the Ethereum blockchain.
      This blockchain acts like a decentralized database where everyone can see its state and cannot be tampered by anyone. Once you acquired a card, it is written in
      the blockchain and it remains forever yours.
      </p>
      <p>
      The other cool stuff is that you can check the logic behind GameCard by auditing the Smart Contract. You can have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xa25e8050f80ee99a17e861cd0931d5d362caa34e">contract on Etherscan</a>
      or the front-end hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fluffycatware/gamecards"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="ui header" id="what-do-i-need">
        What do I need ?
      </h2>
      <p>You only need a browser to view cards and cards details. However, you will need <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> to buy, lease and sell cards.
      MetaMask is a browser (<i class="fab fa-chrome"></i> Chrome and <i class="fab fa-firefox"></i> Firefox) plugin that bridge the Ethereum blockchain
      and is the easiest way to interact with Smart Contract.</p>
      <p>
        This plugin provides a wallet where you can send some Ether (Ξ) in order to execute operations. This plugin is your only <b>login access</b> to buy, lease and sell cards !
        Thus, there is no registration nor login form, just install and unlock a wallet on MetaMask and you have now access to every GameCard features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following video gives an introduction and a setup guide for MetaMask :

      <p>Storing or updating data on the blockchain require a fee. Thus, managing your card (<i>i.e.</i> sell it, edit it etc...), require you
         to pay a small fee to those who maintain the blockchain. You can set the maximal fee you want to pay for, as so, you can set a very low
         fee if you accept that your operation take more time.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, there is a 1% fee on each card transaction (sell or lease). We are proud to reverse 10% of the profits generated by the initial cards sales
        to FluffyCat. Note that this 10% cut is only applied to the initial sale and will not be subtracted to your profits from selling or leasing cards.
